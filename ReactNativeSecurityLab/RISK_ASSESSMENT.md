# React Native Security Risk Assessment

## DREAD Risk Assessment Framework

The DREAD model is used to calculate risk ratings for security vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is assigned a score from 1-5 for each category:

- **Damage**: How bad would an attack be?
- **Reproducibility**: How easy is it to reproduce the attack?
- **Exploitability**: How much effort is required to exploit the vulnerability?
- **Affected Users**: How many users would be impacted?
- **Discoverability**: How easy is it to discover the vulnerability?

## Vulnerability Risk Assessment

| Vulnerability | Damage | Reproducibility | Exploitability | Affected Users | Discoverability | Total |
|---------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Hardcoded API Key | 3 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 21 |
| Insecure AsyncStorage | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 19 |
| HTTP instead of HTTPS | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 21 |
| Hardcoded Credentials | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 22 |
| Insecure JWT Handling | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 2 | 17 |
| Plain Text Password Storage | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 20 |

## Vulnerability Prioritization

### Critical (Score â‰¥ 20)
1. **Hardcoded Credentials** (22): Allows immediate unauthorized access
2. **Hardcoded API Key** (21): Potential for API abuse and service theft
3. **HTTP instead of HTTPS** (21): All traffic can be intercepted and manipulated
4. **Plain Text Password Storage** (20): User credentials easily compromised

### High (Score 15-19)
1. **Insecure AsyncStorage** (19): Sensitive data unprotected on device
2. **Insecure JWT Handling** (17): Token theft and session hijacking possible

## Remediation Recommendations

### Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **Hardcoded Credentials**: 
   - Remove hardcoded values
   - Implement proper authentication flow

2. **Hardcoded API Key**:
   - Move secrets to secure storage
   - Use environment variables or a secure secret management solution

3. **HTTP instead of HTTPS**:
   - Enforce HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement certificate pinning

4. **Plain Text Password Storage**:
   - Never store passwords
   - Use secure authentication tokens instead

### High Vulnerabilities
1. **Insecure AsyncStorage**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data before storage
   - Consider using Secure Storage solutions or Keychain

2. **Insecure JWT Handling**:
   - Implement token validation
   - Check token expiration
   - Verify token signatures
